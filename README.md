Example from http://www.lihaoyi.com/hands-on-scala-js/#IntegratingClient-Server

Run with `sbt app/run`

It fails with:
```
[error] java.lang.RuntimeException: No main class detected.
```

# Wanted
Help wanted to update this project:
- Make it work
- configure appJS to use npmDependencies provided by sbt-scalajs-bundler
  (as in https://github.com/dportabella/scalajs-bootstrap4-examples )
- configure appJVM to use slick and provide a simple example
